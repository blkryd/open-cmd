# Open command window here (Admin)

Shift+right-clicking a folder, or its background, will give you extra commands
like **Open command window here** and **Copy as path**. This Registry file will
add an option for **Open command window here (Admin)**, which as implied will
open a Command Prompt as Administrator.

Ether run the batch file in an elevated prompt or run the reg file.
